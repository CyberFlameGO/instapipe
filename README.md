API Demo: [instapipe.herokuapp.com/stories.json](https://instapipe.herokuapp.com/stories.json)

This will be used for [whereisfelix.today](https://whereisfelix.today), as well as to send stories to my friends who don't use Instagram every day (good for them), via Telegram.

All messages are automatically being piped over a Telegram channel, stored on Google Cloud Storage, and the metadata in a Postgres database.
